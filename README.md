DevArena is a curated platform for discovering hackathons in one place.  
It helps students and developers quickly find upcoming hackathons without jumping across multiple websites.

The goal of DevArena is to keep hackathon discovery **simple, clean, and accessible**.


## What DevArena Does

DevArena brings together hackathons from different platforms and presents them in a single, easy-to-browse interface. Users can explore opportunities, filter them based on how they want to participate, and directly access the official hackathon pages.


## Key Features

- Centralized list of upcoming hackathons  
- Online and offline participation filters  
- Clean, distraction-free interface  
- Mobile-friendly pagination  
- Direct links to official hackathon pages  


## Why DevArena Exists

Finding hackathons often means checking multiple platforms, scrolling through cluttered pages, or missing opportunities due to poor discovery. DevArena was created to solve this by offering a focused space where builders can quickly see what’s available and decide where to invest their time and effort.



## Who It’s For

DevArena is built for:

- Students exploring hackathons for learning and experience  
- Developers looking to build and compete regularly  
- First-time participants searching for beginner-friendly events  
- Builders who value clarity and speed over noise  



## Vision

DevArena aims to grow into a reliable hub for hackathon discovery, helping builders spend less time searching and more time building.
